    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Injera is a soft, spongy Ethiopian flatbread made from fermented teff flour, giving it a slightly sour taste.
         Its porous texture soaks up sauces, making it perfect for eating with stews and lentils.
          Often used as both a base and utensil, injera is essential in Ethiopian meals.</p>
